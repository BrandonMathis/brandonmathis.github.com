Sometimes I like to do things over and over and over again. Well, not me, my computer. Here is how I get him to do it!

```
>: repeat 5 echo ‘hello’
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
```

```sh
#!/bin/sh
function usage(){
  cat <<EOF
Usage: $0 <integer> <command>

Repeat <command> <integer> number of time
EOF
}
 
if [ -z $1 ] || ! [[ "$1" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]
then
  usage
  exit 1
fi
 
i=0
num=$1
shift
while [ $(( i += 1 )) -le $num ]; do
  eval "$@"
done
```
