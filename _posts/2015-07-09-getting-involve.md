In 2010 I graduated from East Carolina University with a degree in computer science and no
idea what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. Like any your kid, I wanted to move out
to the west coast, grow a beard, starting working for Google or Facebook or something cool
and become rich. I has little to no knowledge of what the real software development industry
was like. I had never heard of open source. I had been exposed to many different programming
languages (Lisp, C, Java, Python, Prolog, Cold Fusion and several others) and had no idea how to apply my
academic knowledge of Computer Science to the real world. So, like any youngster that knows
how to open a terminal and type `javac main.java` I slapped "Java" on my resume and line up
some interviews.

That quickly got me an interview through a profession that I had done some contracting work with
for Boeing at ECU. They asked me some pretty basic questions and threw in a "Oh, and can you fix
our website?" "Sure" I answered foolishly. I had never written anything outside of a tiny
Cold-Fusion app (if you could call it that). Little did I know, that one tiny slip in my interview
put me in a track that would forever change my life.

##My Foray into Open Source

It was a [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) website. From the minute I FTP'd into the bluehost
server where the core codebase was I knew I was in trouble. I had never seen so many files!
There were directories nest five, six, or seven levels deep. My employer had handed me no
documentation and actually didn't even know that the site was written in Drupal. Had I not
stumbled onto a `passwords.txt` file that was hidden away deep within the recesses of the codebase
I probably would have lost my job because I had been starring into this endless black hole
of text documents for three weeks now. 

However, flash-forward 4 months, I had a firm grip on what Drupal was. It was a CMS. It was
written in PHP. You could install modules in it and it was "Open Source." "Oh yea" I remember
my boss telling me. "The software that powers our site is Open Source so we got it for free."
That was my first definition of "Open Source".

Yes! Open Source Software is software that you can just download, for free, off the internet! How
glorious. It wasn't until I ran into my first problem with Drupal did I **truly** understand
what open source was.
