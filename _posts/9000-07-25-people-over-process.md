title: People over Process
---

Anyone that has worked a project using the [Agile](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) process
has probably heard "People over Process." It is a re-wording of the #1 value of the Agile
Manifesto.

I often see this point as the first thing that is dropped when people adapt "Agile." Years
of throwing the Agile methodologies about and mutating them to fit your needs has given rise
to zealots who insist that **THEIR** way of doing agile is the "One true way".


##Why "Agile" is Broken

I put Agile in quotes because I do not think that Agile itself is broken. I think the way that it
is being implemented in teams is broken. Hiring an Agile artisan and telling that person to implement
the Agile process across an entire development team is just plane wrong. Especially if that artisan just
starts making demands about 

Agile was created to combat the [waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) process
of developing software but, just as Agile demands we iterate on our software development processes, it
it time that we iterate on our process.
