I love coding in coffee shops. It brings a few of my favorite things in the world together into one place: code, coffee, community, and music. So, when I took a solo trip up to Brooklyn I decided I would tour a handful of the local favorite coffee shops and do a code kata at each stop. I only managed to get to 3 before the caffeine got to me but experience was great fun. Iâ€™d like to share it with you!

What is a code kata? Itâ€™s a concept taken directly from martial arts where you build a simple application or small function with slight variations to hone your skills as a programmer. There is a strong focus on repetition which builds "mental muscle memory." I often do a code kata every morning at work just to warm up for the day and I will try out new languages, libraries and code editors when doing the kata.

The kata I chose was simple and is a personal favorite, the Roman numeral converter. The principle of this kata is quite simple: take a decimal number and convert it to its roman numeral equivalent. At first blush, that sounds hard but it is actually quite simple once you get a hang of the concept. What is hard is doing it in languages you donâ€™t use every day while being jacked up on caffeine!

### Cafe Beit (Language: Elixir, Drink: Cortado)

![Beit Storefront](/public/images/beit.png)

I first passed by this shop on my way to pick up lunch at [The Meatball Shop](http://www.themeatballshop.com/) just off Bedford Ave and decided to make it my first stop. I chose to pair a cortado with Elixir because they seemed to have a lot in common. A cortado is two parts milk, one part espresso and with Elixir you get the power of [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) with a beautiful syntax inspired by Ruby.

Elixir is a strongly typed language with immutable variables, meaning that once you assign a value to a variable, you cannot modify it. This encourages a strong functional pattern and heavy use of recursion, which can take some time to get used to. But, I tinker around a lot with Elixir, so this was a breeze. In 20 minutes, I was done with an implementation that utilizes the power of Elixir function overloading via differing arity and Elixirâ€™s â€˜whenâ€™ keyword. For more information on this technique and identifying functions in Elixir, [check the docs](http://elixir-lang.org/crash-course.html#identifying-functions). ðŸ‘“

~~~elixir
defmodule Romanize do
  @map [
    { "D",  500 },
    { "CD", 400 },
    { "C",  100 },
    { "L",  50 },
    { "XL", 40 },
    { "X",  10 },
    { "IX", 9 },
    { "V",  5 },
    { "IV", 4 },
    { "I",  1 }
  ]

  def convert(decimal) do
    convert(decimal, @map)
  end

  defp convert(0, _numerals), do: ""

  defp convert(decimal, [{ roman, arabic } | tail ]) when decimal >= arabic  do
    roman <> convert(decimal - arabic, [{ roman, arabic } | tail])
  end

  defp convert(decimal, [{ _roman, arabic } | tail]) when decimal < arabic do
    convert(decimal, tail)
  end
end

### Blue Bottle (Language: Rust, Drink: Machiato with sparkling water)

![Blue Bottle Storefront](/public/images/blue-bottle.png)

Ready for a challenge, I jogged over to Blue Bottle coffee and cracked open [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) for the first time ever! I went with a Macchiato (one part espresso, one part milk) and a glass of sparkling water for this kata because thatâ€™s what Rust feels like to me: lots of power with just enough boundaries in place to keep you safe. The glass of sparkling water pairs well with a strong espresso drink like this just as [Cargo](https://crates.io/), the de-facto build tool for Rust, serves as an excellent pairing to Rust. I could never imagine using Rust without Cargo!

With a simple `cargo init` I was up and running. Rust even ships with an excellent test library that you can take advantage of with via the `cargo test` command. This kata took me nearly an hour and lots of reading to get done but I finally got it working!


~~~rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]

pub struct Roman
{
    numeral: String,
}

impl<'a> PartialEq<Roman> for &'a str {
    fn eq(&self, roman: &Roman) -> bool {
        self == &roman.numeral
    }
    fn ne(&self, roman: &Roman) -> bool {
        self != &roman.numeral
    }
}

static ARABIC_ROMAN : [(i32, &'static str); 13] = [
    (1000, "M"),
    (900, "CM"),
    (500, "D"),
    (400, "CD"),
    (100, "C"),
    (90, "XC"),
    (50, "L"),
    (40, "XL"),
    (10, "X"),
    (9, "IX"),
    (5, "V"),
    (4, "IV"),
    (1, "I")
];

impl From<i32> for Roman {
    fn from(decimal: i32) -> Roman {
        let mut decimal = decimal;
        let mut roman_numeral = String::new();
        for&(divisor, roman_char) in ARABIC_ROMAN.into_iter() {
            while decimal >= divisor {
                decimal -= divisor;
                roman_numeral.push_str(roman_char);
            }
        }
        Roman { numeral: roman_numeral }
    }
}

### Tobyâ€™s Estate Coffee (Language: Clojure, Drink: Cappuccino)

![Toby's Estate Storefront](/public/images/tobys.png)

Amped up on coffee and the high that I got from managing to actually complete this kata in Rust, I walked about one block over to Tobyâ€™s Estate Coffee. Ready to give my brain a bit of a break, I went with [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and a Cappuccino. Clojure because it is one of my favorite languages to do code katas in, and a Cappuccino because I knew I would be waiting around a lot for the JVM to start up! Shortly after receiving my drink, I fired up [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) and initialized a new Clojure project. Leiningen is the de-facto build tool for Clojure to how Cargo for Rust. Instead of using the Clojure compiler you can just do a `lein run` or `lein test` to execute your code.

Clojure isnâ€™t [strongly typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing), so I didnâ€™t have to deal with the same type errors I was struggling with in Rust and Elixir. The [polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation) style of function calling that Clojure uses along with parenthesis everywhere (as per the Lisp standard) can warp your brain for a few minutes as you get into that "mode" of thinking. Iâ€™ve never done this specific kata in Clojure so it took me longer than expected to complete. However, I got it done in just under 30 minutes. I went with a solution that involved writing my own reducer to iterate through a list of numerals and using some basic math to build up by roman numeral string with the proper roman lexicons.

~~~clojure
(ns roman.core)

(def numerals
  `((500 "D")
    (400 "CD")
    (100 "C")
    (90  "XC")
    (50  "L")
    (40  "XL")
    (10  "X")
    (9   "IX")
    (5   "V")
    (4   "IV")
    (1   "I")))

(defn roman-reducer [decimal numerals]
  (if (empty? numerals) ()
    (let [[[value roman-char]] numerals count (int (/ decimal value))]
      (cons (list count roman-char)
            (roman-reducer (- decimal (* count value)) (rest numerals))))))

(defn romanize [decimal]
  (apply str
         (flatten
          (map (fn [[count roman-char]] (take count (repeat roman-char)))
               (roman-reducer decimal numerals)))))

At this point I was zoominâ€™ on coffee and having a borderline panic attack! Heart racing, I strolled back to the Airbnb where I typed up the outline of this blog post. Now, I wouldn't suggest drinking 3 espresso drinks back to back but the exercise of doing a simple code kata in 3 different languages was a great experience. It helped me gain context on the difference between these three programming languages (Elixir, Clojure, Rust) that I donâ€™t use every day. You should try it out yourself sometime with a few languages you have been curious about for a while!
