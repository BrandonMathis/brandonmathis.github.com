# Get Involved

Over the past 4 years I have hoodwinked my way into the inner circles of people who I highly-respected and even idolized.

* I obtained a job I though I could never have.
* I have had beer with people who I though would never know my name.
* I have been given the respect and adoration of people that I barely know.

People shower me with praise and even let me talk at their conferences- because a few years ago I decided to do one simple thing. I got involved in the open source community.

## How I got involved in open source

### DOTA

As a kid, back in 2003 I started playing a lot of the popular Warcraft III mod Defense of the Ancients. The mod was built by a community of WC3 modders. Who were 

### My First Job
* Was told to rebuild a website
* Boss suggested Drupal because it was Open Source and free to download
* Open Source = Free Software
* I became a regular poster to the Drupal forums 
* People helped me solved my problems
* Within a few months, I was helping people solve those same problems that I had been assisted on

## Open Source is not "Free Software"

Open Source is not free to play. People fail to realize that the very bedrock upon which the foundation of their company rests if Open Source Software. We all pay for the privilege to use OS and that payment is to give something back to the community.

## How Getting Involved in Open Source has helped me

You do not need to be a coder

You do not need to be brilliant

We: are not brilliant  
We: do not have all the answers  
We: need your help  

### Triaging Issues

http://www.codetriage.com/

#### Confirm that the problem is duplicable
Simply attempt to use the library at the version specified in the bug report to re-create the issue the submitter is experiencing. If you are able to re-create the issue, respond with a simple "I was able to re-create this on my machine" with a link to the code that you used to re-create the issue.

#### Follow up on dead issues
Find really old bug reports and ping the author asking if they managed to find a fix. Often, people solve their problems but do not report back with a proper fix. Sometimes the fix is as simple as upgrading to a newer version. Issues like this can be closed, reducing the open bug report count for a project which is a boon to Open Source maintainers.

### Reporting Issues
Now, before you just go in a throw a large log dump into an email thread or github issue take a minute to address the following things:

#### Be Humble
These people are not sitting in cold storage waiting to help you. They are offering their own personal time to solve a problem that you have. Ask for guidance or suggestions, don't outright demand a fix.

#### Clarity

Make your issue easily accessible and duplicable. Create a small github repo whose sole purpose is to re-create the issue you are experiencing. Then maintainers and contributors can clone your code down to play around with the bug in a small sandbox.

#### Be considerate
Avoid calling things "stupid" or "useless"

Research beforehand. Read through old bug reports and do not submit duplicate bug reports for the same issue.

Offer to write a patch if someone can give guidance.

Remember that there is a finite amount of attention that contributors and maintainers can pay to each bug report. Give people the time that they need to investigate your problem. 

#### REPORT BACK!
Sooner or later, you will solve your problem. Don't keep this information private. Respond back with the steps that you took to fix your problem. People in the future will likely experience the same problem and the worst possible thing that they could find is "Managed to fix this on my own" with no further explication
